# Automatic Differentiation through Tensor and Operational Calculus

Repository for the paper Automatic Differentiation through Tensor and Operational Calculus

## Abstract

In this paper we take a look at _Automatic Differentiation_ through the eyes of _Tensor_ and _Operational Calculus_. This work is best consumed as supplementary material for learning tensor and operational calculus by those already familiar with automatic differentiation. To that purpose, we provide a simple implementation of automatic differentiation, where the steps taken are explained through tensor and operational calculus.
