\begin{abstract}
In this paper we take a look at \emph{Automatic Differentiation} through the eyes of \emph{Operational Calculus}. This work is to be viewed as an educational tool for those already familiar with automatic differentiation, who want to familiarize themselves with operational calculus. To that purpose, we provide a simple implementation of automatic differentiation, where the steps taken are explained through tensor calculus and operational calculus.
