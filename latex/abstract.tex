\begin{abstract}
  In this paper we take a look at \emph{Automatic Differentiation} through the eyes of \emph{Tensor} and \emph{Operational Calculus}. This work is to be viewed as a supplementary educational tool for those already familiar with automatic differentiation, that are looking to familiarize themselves with tensor and operational calculus. To that purpose, we provide a simple implementation of automatic differentiation, where the steps taken are explained through tensor and operational calculus.
