\section{Conclusions}

In this work we provided a simple implementation of automatic differentiation, where the steps taken were explained in the language of tensor and operational calculus. It aimed to serve as a gentle introduction into tensor and operational calculus for those already familiar with automatic differentiation.
We hope such an introduction motivates the practitioner to look into more advanced uses of operational calculus that would span beyond a description of automatic differentiation.
