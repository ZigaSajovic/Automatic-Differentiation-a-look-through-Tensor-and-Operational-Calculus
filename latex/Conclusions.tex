\section{Conclusions}

In this work we provided a simple implementation of automatic differentiation, where the steps taken were explained in the language of tensor and operational calculus. It aimed to serve as a gentle introduction into tensor and operational calculus for those already familiar with automatic differentiation.
We hope this introduction motivates the practitioner of differentiable programming to look into other uses of operational calculus that would span beyond a description of automatic differentiation presented in this work.
