\subection{Differentiable Derivatives}\label{sec:orderReduction}
 
The ability to treat the $k$-th derivative of a program, as part of a different differentiable program appears useful in many fields. To that purpose, we must be able to threat the derivative itself as a differentiable program. This is easily done given our minimal implementation, as we are dealing only with the projections of the operators to the unit $N$-cube.
